This project is in no way meant to be designed perfectly (yet). This is 100% a project for myself to practice fetching data dynamically from an external API, figuring out how to optimally use SSR/SSG and to enhance my knowledge on NextJS. I'm using the PokeAPI v2, which can be found at https://pokeapi.co/.
